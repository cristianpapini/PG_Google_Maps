### <h1 align=center> UNDERSTANDING OF THE CURRENT SITUATION

When talking about tourism, recreation and leisure, a large part of the searches that are carried out are concentrated in the area of food! In addition to looking for habitual preferences, diners also want to have new experiences, not only when they travel but also around the area where they live, which is why having complete and sufficient information to make decisions about where to eat becomes a necessity.

In the same way, entrepreneurs are increasingly taking into account a market study to carry out their investments, based on information that comes directly from sources that are active, making use of the services of places to eat and that move from one place to another looking for new options.

Due to what was stated above, we decided to put together tools that help both diners and businessmen to meet their objectives regarding the area of food, specifically in the State of Florida, United States, making available to the former an informative and interactive app, according to starting data entered by themselves, so that they obtain specific recommendations, and for the latter, market analysis and application of Machine Learning models that show them where to open new food places.
